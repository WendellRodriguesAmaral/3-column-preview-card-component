# Frontend Mentor - 3-column preview card component

![Design preview for the 3-column preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

```
This is a simple FrontEnd Mentor challenge.

Where I remembered many basics of html and css.

Some features such as flex-box, grid-layout, hover and responsive layout were used.

Hope you like.
